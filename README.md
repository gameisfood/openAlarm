# OpenAlarm
This project was started with the vision to create a one stop alarm solution.

Open source, supporting external devices(such as curtains via RF, and coffee machines over ethernet), and all multimedia sources. It would be intelligent enough to wake you up before hand if there is a traffic jam.

If you want to wake up to the smell of coffee, become a contributor.

#WIP
Currently it is at it's early stages with no UI or any defined way to set it up on your pi.
